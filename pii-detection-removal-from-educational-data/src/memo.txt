v1.2
split input to make the maximum length of input 1024


v1.3
downsample


v2.0
optuna
    1. simply create objective function of optuna with deberta-v3-base
        1. only learning_rate
        2. list up all the parameters to be optimized
    3. is my optuna including early stopping?
    2. classificate the process of optuna to enable the optuna to select the best parameter whenever I want to


v3.0
enable google colab to use optuna


v4.0
create new dataset to make oputuna to select the best parameter more practically

then, optuna again


v5.0
create a loss function suitable for the objective function f5
b5 threthold 0.9


v6.0
consider trailing_whitespace
LSTM
/n/n -> to some special token like [KAIGYO]
" " -> to some special token like [SPACE] ?
avarage the result of each fold
weighted avarage the result of each fold
input min, av, max, std to LGBM


v7.0
find the other model to ansamble















MEMO:
batch_size * steps = total number of the data
step size is defined by the batch size automatically
the step count is different between P100 and T4x2 because the batch size is different
how to define the batch size?
if I can define the batch size manually, the step size for the P100 and T4x2 will be the same
P100: 2553 steps, 2553 / 3 = 851 (steps), 6807 / 851 = 8  (batch size)
T4x2: 1278 steps, 1278 / 3 = 426 (steps), 6807 / 426 = 16 (batch size)
epoch = the number of learning using the whole data
T4x2: 1278 / 3 = 426 (steps), 6807 / 426 = 16 (batch size)
